# Instructions:
 1. Download the pretrained weights of the SSD, Retinanet and YOLO model and save it in this folder.
 2. The model uses the pretrained weights stored in this folder for the object detection.
 3. Do not forget to change the names of the pretrained weight in the main.py
 4. Or the more easy thing to do is the change the names of the downloaded weights to the following to match the names in the main.py file:
 
  Retinanet weights : resnet50_coco_best_v2.1.0.h5
  
  SSD weights : VGG_VOC0712Plus_SSD_300x300_ft_iter_160000.h5
  
  YOLO weights : yolo.h5
